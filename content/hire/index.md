I'm James Porter, and you can hire me to build, operate, debug, and
optimize software for you on a contract basis. I'm currently looking
for one more client to work with part-time, ideally around 10-20 hours
a week.

I've been programming professionally for ten years, mostly focusing on
web applications, infrastructure, and data pipelines. I have the most
experience with Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Postgres, but I've used
everything from C to Haskell to Neo4j over the years. I'm very good at
learning new technology as needed; choice of languages and tools will
not be an obstacle to our work together. I have a deep understanding
of computers, from assembly to abstraction. I can debugging complex
systems issues and am equally comfortable on greenfield projects or a
gnarly legacy codebase. More details about my past work on my
[resume](static/resume.pdf).

For many years I worked at the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com) as a Facilitator, where I wrote a lot
of code, but my role also involved community management, coaching,
business strategy, etc. As a result I'm an excellent written and oral
communicator, a good teacher, and can see and manage the human factors
that play into a project's success. I'm also great at keeping sight of
bigger picture organizational goals and finding the simplest technical
solution to meet them.

My rate is $150 an hour. If that sounds too expensive to you, please
[get in touch](mailto:hire@jamesporter.me) anyway. I'm interested in
working with academics and nonprofits, who I know can't always pay the
same rate as corporate clients, and I'm happy to negotiate a lower
rate if your project is exciting to me.

If you're interested in working with me, send an email to
[hire@jamesporter.me](mailto:hire@jamesporter.me) with a short
description of your organization and the work. From there we'll set up
a time to chat and decide if it's a good fit. Looking forward to
hearing from you!
