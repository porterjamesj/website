### Tombstone 💀🪦🥀

This page used to have some notes about a [visualizer](https://github.com/porterjamesj/goodreads-vis) I made for [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) activity, mostly just as an excuse to learn some frontend programming. It stopped working years ago due to unclear browser changes, and by that point I had stopped using Goodreads, so I never bothered to fix it. So now it's just a little memorial, here only out of my desire to not break URLs in case someone was linking to it. RIP Goodreads visualizer.
