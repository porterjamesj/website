Summary: I made a web page to visualize Goodreads activity

I recently started using [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/) because I
was curious about how many books I read in a year (so far in 2016 the
answer is "4", in case you were curious). I also made a web page that
draws plots of Goodreads activity, which you can find
[here](http://jamesporter.me/misc/goodreads-vis/). You have to enter a
Goodreads "user id", which is the number in the URL on a profile
page. For example my profile URL is
`https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51772290-james-porter`, so my user
id is `51772290`.

Mostly this was just an excuse for me to do some web frontend
programming, but one surprisingly fun thing that I've been doing is
just typing random or potentially interesting numbers into the user id
box and seeing what comes up. Often the result is "nothing", but here
are some potentially interesting things I've found:

- The [two](http://jamesporter.me/misc/goodreads-vis/#/1)
  [founders](http://jamesporter.me/misc/goodreads-vis/#/5) of
  Goodreads, both of whom have read a lot of books.
- [Someone](http://jamesporter.me/misc/goodreads-vis/#/14278801) who's
  only activity is having read the *Hunger Games* and *Divergent*
  series.
- The [millionth user](http://jamesporter.me/misc/goodreads-vis/#/1000000),
  for whom there isn't enough information to draw any plots.
- [Myself!](http://jamesporter.me/misc/goodreads-vis/#/51772290).
- [Someone](http://jamesporter.me/misc/goodreads-vis/#/9298854) who
  has logged almost as much reading as the Goodreads founders, much of
  it romance novels and *Ouran High School Host Club*.

At one point I found someone with over 120 thousand pages of reading
logged, but I forgot to write down their user id. Also, perhaps
unsurprisingly, most people tend to rate the books they read four or
five stars. Anyway, you can use this to visualize your own activity,
your friends', or just poke around randomly at others and see what you
find, hopefully it's amusing!
