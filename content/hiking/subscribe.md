As you may know, I'm going on a long section hike on the Pacific Crest Trail from July 3rd to roughly the end of September, 2024, starting at Cascade Locks (outside Portland) and ending at Kennedy Meadows South, at the bottom of the Sierras. Some of you have expressed interest in following along with my journey, either because you're interested in joining me for a section, or just out of curiosity.

You can do so by subscribing to my mailing list here:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<form method="post" action="https://gaggle.email/join/jjp-hiking-updates@gaggle.email" class="sans-serif f5 w-5 flex flex-column items-center pt2">
 <div class="pb1">
   <input name="name" type="text" placeholder="Name">

    <input name="email" type="email" placeholder="Email Address">

  <div class="pt2">
    <button class="link dim br2 ph3 pv2 mb2 dib bw0 white bg-green pointer">Subscribe</button>
  </div>
</form>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

This list is only for friends and family, please don't share this page widely.

I'll try to send an update including my progress, location, and any happenings of interest every week or two when I have internet access. They will likely be rather unpolished, as I'll be writing in a state of partial to complete exhaustion from hostels, lodges, etc. while juggling the many "in-town" tasks of a long-distance hiker.

I also may re-use this list for future hikes. Of course, you can unsubscribe at any time :)
