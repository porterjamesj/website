Tuesday, September 19th

- Start: David Logan Shelter
- End: Middlebury Gap
- Approx Miles: 17

My goal today is to go 17 miles to Middlebury Gap, where I'll meet up with Tom, a family friend who lives nearby. Feels sort of funny to have another day off-trail so soon, but I wanted to do stay at the Inn, and I want to visit with Tom, so that's that!

The day dawns clear and bright. Beautiful hiking weather, mostly just through the "green tunnel" of the Battell Wilderness.

We stop and take a break at Sunrise Shelter, the newest shelter on the trail. It's only been open a month! It feels strange after all the decades-old shelters on the rest of the trail. All the corners are square, the wood bright and clean. It also has an ADA-compliant ramp, which is apparently required on newly constructed shelters, even if they're only accessible via miles of rough trail. Whether this makes sense is another popular topic of hiker discussion.

I head out ahead of everyone else, aware of the distance I have yet to cover. I hustle through the sunlit woods, squawked at by a flock of jays I seem to have disturbed. After passing the No Name Backcountry Area I approach Brandon Gap and the Great Cliffs of Mt. Horrid.

After a brief but steep climb up from the gap, I reach the overlook on top of the cliffs. This is apparently nesting habitat for peregrine falcons, and so are closed during their breeding season to protect the birds. Fortunately I've just missed it, so I can take in the spectacular views of the surrounding mountain and the road below.
