Today's the big day. Mt. Mansfield. As Mooch put it a few days ago, it's kind of the point of the whole trip! We're blessed with a clear, windless dayâ€”couldn't ask for more.

Mansfield has several few sub-peaks that are said to resemble a human face when viewed in profile.

I can sort of see it. If you imagine an old man's face in a 19th century political cartoon it feels a bit more plausible. As we approach from the south, we'll cross over the forehead, past the nose, and then on to the chin, which is the peak of the mountain, the trail, and the state!

We make it up to the forehead after some fun and somewhat technical scrambling, ladders, etc.

We arrive at the forehead, where the views are grand.

It feels cool to be up so high along the ridge as we start toward the nose. Easy, smooth rock/road walk, but all in the alpine zone.

We stop for a snack at the visitor center (closed as its the middle of the week) near the nose, which you can't hike on. Apparently its private property, I guess owned by the radio stations whose towers are up there.

A sudden need for solitude overtakes me. Maybe it's because this is a significant point in the hike, and I want to be able to reflect a bit. Whatever the reason, I put on the gas and zoom ahead of everyone else.

The descent from the nose is amazing. Beautiful, stark terrain with views gradually opening up to the east and west.

I even find a random trail sign that says "Subway" on it?!? My trail name was fated appointment clearly[^1].

[^1]: Presumably this sign is labeling a blue-blazed trail? If anyone knows how it got that name, please let me know!
