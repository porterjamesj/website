From September 8th to October 4th 2023, I thru-hiked Vermont's Long Trail. You can read about my journey here—these pages contain my trail journal along with some background to set the scene.

The Long Trail was the first long distance hiking trail in America, and the inspiration for the Appalachian Trail, with which it shares its first 100 miles. It runs 272 miles along the spine of the Green Mountains, from the Vermont-Massachusets border to the Vermont-Canada border. It has a reputation as a difficult thru-hike due to its steep and frequent climbs (especially in the northern section), as well as lots of rain and mud. The trail is maintained by the Green Mountain Club; you can read more about it [on their website](https://www.greenmountainclub.org/the-long-trail/).

### Prologue

Like many who attempt a thru-hike, I'd found myself at a crossroads in life. A few months before starting the hike, I'd ended a relationship, left my job of seven years, and moved out of New York City, my home for most of my adult life. While I felt in my heart that all these changes were necessary, none of them were easy. It was a huge amount of turbulence all at once, and both the job and being a New Yorker were huge components of my identity. Without them I felt distraught, adrift, and unconfident. I needed to do something restorative to help me move on—a thru-hike felt right.

I've harbored a desire to do some kind of thru-hike since I was young, having been aware of the Appalachian Trail and compelled by the quixotic romance of being an "end-to-ender" as long as I can remember. I did a lot of backpacking and wilderness canoeing as a teenager and have always thought of myself as an outdoors-y person, but that fell by the wayside in my 20s. I had a vague desire to reconnect with that part of myself, but never managed to act on it. Now I had the time and the motivation. By the time I'd finished moving out of New York in June, it was too late to start one of the [triple crown trails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking), but the LT seemed perfect. It would only take about a month to hike, I'd have several months to plan, and I've always had an affinity for New England forests, having spent a lot of time in Maine growing up.

After waffling about it for a while, I committed. The first two questions every thru-hiker faces are "When?" and "Which direction?". I decided to go NOBO[^1] in September. NOBO is the traditional direction to hike the LT, and would let me build up my strength in the relatively flat south before hitting the big climbs in the north. September is generally considered a good time to hike—the worst of the summer heat is over, and the bugs are mostly gone. I was also looking for a balance of solitude and socializinga, and I hoped that going in the fall rather than the summer would mean a less crowded trail. I'd also be able to see the peak fall color in the north in early October.

Between a few trips to REI and my old gear from my teenage years, I cobbled together everything I would need. My gear was functional, but *heavy*. My pack and sleeping bag were from 2005, and far from ultralight—just the two of them weighed about nine pounds. I didn't have a scale, so I didn't weight my pack before starting, but I suspect it was over 40 pounds fully loaded.

After an overnight shakedown trip with a friend just to make sure I still remembered how to backpack, I was ready. I bought a train ticket to Pittsfield, Massachusets, near the southern terminus, and booked an overnight stay in town, planning to set out hiking on the morning of Friday, September 8th.

### Notes to self

- Mention transitions book at some point, the "neutral zone"
- Consider talking about all the rain in July somewhere on this page? I feel like its important context but don't know where to fit it in


[^1]: Like any subculture, long-distance backpackers have their fair share of jargon. "NOBO" and "SOBO" are hiker slang for "northbound" and "southbound" respectively. Most long-distance trails run generally north or south. "Are you NOBO or SOBO?" is a common first question to ask when meeting another hiker on the trail.
