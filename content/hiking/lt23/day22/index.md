I'm going to wait for Mooch, Stiltz, and Hang Ten to catch up before I set out for the day, since this will be my last day hiking with them! They'll pull ahead when I hang back to wait for Rachel and Joe at Whiteface Shelter, and I don't expect I'll catch up before they finish.

I have a slow morning to myself eating my breakfast bars and taking pictures of the ski patrol hut and surroundings.

Finally they come hiking up the ski slopes at around 8:30[^1]. "How do you feel?" Stiltz shouts down to Hang Ten. "Horrible!" he shouts back, "...but I'm having a great time!" We have a laugh at this and then set out up the trail.

A couple hours of hiking go by quickly and we're at Whiteface Shelter, halfway up the eponymous mountain. We eat a snack and say a bittersweet goodbye. I take a photo to remember them by and then they head out and we're split up for goodâ€”or so I thought...[^2].

I hang around the shelter for a while by myself, and quickly get bored and listless. It's a cloudy and hazy day which I'm sure doesn't help my mood. I coordinate with Rachel by text a bit. They're planning to park at Beaver Meadow trailhead, hike up to meet me via Beaver Meadow and Whiteface trails, then hike down to Route 15 with me tomorrow and get a shuttle back to their car.
