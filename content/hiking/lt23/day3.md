I woke up today at 4am with horrible back pain, tossing and turning before finally giving up and taking ibuprofen to get back to sleep. Had some Inception-style nested lucid dreams before waking up. First, I dreamt that a bear was messing with my tent and I had to yell to scare it off. I woke up from that dream to bright light, and the hustle and bustle of city noise. I unzipped my tent and looked outside. I was in an alley the same size and shape as the campsite I'd set up in, with a busy street right where the trail would be. The buildings were pastel colors; it felt like I was in Spain. I sat up to find myself face to face with two young Black guys wearing full moto gear and charging their one-wheeled scooters. They said they were also on a tour. I commented that they probably couldn't get very far on those scooters without needing to charge them. "You'd be surprised," they said. I asked how long their tour was and they said three days. Then I woke up again on a couch in dark house. I got up and went outside, and it turned out it was the house I grew up in. There were driveway reflectors set up all over the yard, underneath where the birdfeeders used to be. There was an ocelot running around in them. I chased after it and tried to yell at it until I woke up for real. Anyway, I hope this back pain doesn't get worse!

It's still early when I get out of bed and quickly pack up camp after eating my usual trail breakfast of Pop-Tarts. I feel so much better than I did last night, and I'm bounding up the mountain towards Goddard Shelter. After seeing the terrain, I'm glad I didn't try to push it last night. It's not that steep, but I was really cooked last nightâ€”I don't think I'd have been able to do this.

I reach the shelter to find Particle still packing up. I also meet Randy, an AT section hiker. I end up hiking on-and-off with the two of them for most of the day, which is relatively easy and uneventful. We cross over Glastenbury Mountain early in the day. Sadly the fire tower on top is closed, apparently its been deemed unsafe. I doubt there'd be a view anyway since it's foggy. I can see how this area gets its eerie reputation. The woods here just have a kind of a mysterious, otherworldly feel.

I stopped for lunch at Kid Gore Shelter.

Passed by a few beaver bogs and stopped to take a break.

I reached Story Spring Shelter, which is surrounded by a big clearing for tenting, just as it started raining. Particle and arrived soon after. Randy's from Brooklyn and just graduated high school in the spring. She's taking a gap year before going to college at UVM in Burlington. She's excited to get out of NYC, which is so strange for me to hearâ€”it's so hard for me to imagine wanted to leave New York! I guess its different if you grew up there. Its really nice hanging out with the two of them for the evening though, really different from last night by myself. Its funny feeling so old though. I can feel the life experience gap between my and the two of them. Have to try not to "back in my day" and remember to treat everyone like an adult ðŸ™‚. I was thinking how the trail is like RC in that wayâ€”brings together people of a variety of ages and walks of life who are so different from each other, but have one goal in common[^1]. It's cool. Speaking of RC, I've been thinking about my life and future while I hike, and it strikes me that its easy to think about the big questions about here because none of it feels scary. Things that worry you in everyday life just feel sort of inconsequential, like they're about a different world that has no bearing on this one.

Tomorrow's a big dayâ€”our first real climb up Stratton. I'm a little nervous but I'm sure we'l be fine. Randy is carrying so much weight (eight days of food, playing cards, four pound tent!) I hope she manages. The thunderstorms Parfait was worried about seem to have dissipated to just a light rain fortunately. I'm also a little worried about being able to get a hitch into Manchester Center to resupply[^2], but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

[^1]: "RC" is the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), my former employer. It's a free, self-directed retreat for programmers. People of all experience levels and ages come from all over to get better at programming by working on whatever projects they want to; teaching and learning from each other with no imposed structure.
[^2]: Manchester Center is where I'm planning to stop and make my first resupply in a couple days. Thru-hikers typically buy a few days of food at a time, then go into a nearby "trail town" to resupply on food and gear when they run out. Some people mail themselves boxes ahead of time; I'm just planning to shop at grocery stores. Manchester Center is about 50 miles into the LT and a popular first resupply stop. The town itself is five miles from the trail along a busy road, so practically you have to hitchhike in and back out. Drivers in Vermont are generally friendly and happy to give hikers a ride.
