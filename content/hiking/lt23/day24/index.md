Sunday, October 1st

- Start: Roundtop Shelter
- End: Spruce Ledge Camp
- Approx Miles: 15.1

It's nice to actually meet and hang out with everyone in the shelter this morning after our hectic encounter last night. I apologize for waking them all up. Everyone's very friendly, there are five SOBOs (including an oddly interesting and friendly woman named Worm) and an older couple out for an overnight.

I tell my subway story when they ask my trail name, one of the older couple used to live in New York so we talk about that for a while. Worm mentions her re-supply plan is that she drove along the trail and cached bear cans full of food along the way before starting. Interesting strategy, haven't heard of anyone doing that before.

The water situation here is neat. There's a little pump, with instructions for how to prime it, haven't seen that before. FarOut is full of people claiming the pump is broken, other people claiming those people are idiots and you just need to prime it, and yet more people complaining that someone left the priming jug empty[^1].

I'm enjoying myself and kind of want to stay, but I know I have a long-ish day ahead of me (15 miles to Spruce Camp) so I leave around 8am while everyone else is still packing up.

[^1] It works just fine for me.
