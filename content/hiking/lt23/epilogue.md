## Gear thoughts

- One trekking pole
- Shoes vs boots
- Overall weight
- Pad
- Heat layers (only had puffy and thermal shirt, no fleece or sun hoodie)
- Sleeping bag (too heavy)
- Things I sent back: map & compass, hat (?)


## What I'd do differently

- Plan less overall
- Would take more pictures of people rather than just landscapes
- More videos
