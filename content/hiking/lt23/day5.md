I'm up and at 'em early today, and get hiking quickly. I'm a bit nervous to go into town—it's my first time, so I don't really know how long getting a hitch in will take, or how long it will take me to do my errands. I'm also not sure if I'm going to stay the night in town or try to hitch back out to the trail in the afternoon. I've heard a rumor that the VFW lets hikers camp in their backyard, but I don't want to count on it. So much of thru-hiking is like this; you're operating on information passed down the trail and from FarOut comments that's anywhere from days to months out of date. Trail conditions, business hours, trail angel's sentiments towards hikers—all can change quickly and you just have to do your best with the info you have an be willing to adapt. It's a big adjustment for me as someone who likes to have a plan for every contingency.

Anyway, the trail is flat and cruisy[^1] from here to VT Route 11/30. Much of it follows a disused forest road, and the enveloping fog gives everything a spooky vibe.




[^1]: "Cruisy" is a haiker-ism that just means easy trail that you can "cruise" along, covering miles quickly due to little elevation change, nicely groomed trail with few few obstaces, etc.
